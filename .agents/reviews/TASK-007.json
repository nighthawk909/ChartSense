  "overall_comments": "TASK-007 partially complete. The useEffect dependency issues in Dashboard.tsx have been correctly fixed - fetchQuotes and fetchIndicators are properly wrapped in useCallback with appropriate dependencies, and the main useEffect correctly includes fetchQuotes in its dependency array with proper interval cleanup. However, the task requirement to 'Add ESLint exhaustive-deps warnings to catch future issues' has NOT been implemented. No ESLint configuration file exists in apps/web/ to enable this rule, so future dependency issues won't be caught automatically. This is a REQUIRED fix before approval.",
